JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.
Accessing Object Methods
You can access an object method using a dot notation. The syntax is:

objectName.methodKey()
You can access property by calling an objectName and a key. You can access a method by calling an objectName and a key for that method along with (). For example,

// accessing method and property
const person = {
    name: 'Zerubabel',
    greet: function() { console.log('hello'); }
};

// accessing property
person.name; // Zerubabel

// accessing method
person.greet(); // hello
Run Code
Here, the greet method is accessed as person.greet() instead of person.greet.

If you try to access the method with only person.greet, it will give you a function definition.

person.greet; // Æ’ () { console.log('hello'); }
JavaScript Built-In Methods
In JavaScript, there are many built-in methods. For example,

let number = '23.32';
let result = parseInt(number);

console.log(result); // 23
Run Code
Here, the parseInt() method of Number object is used to convert numeric string value to an integer value.

Adding a Method to a JavaScript Object
You can also add a method in an object. For example,

// creating an object
let student = { };

// adding a property
student.name = 'Zerubabel';

// adding a method
student.greet = function() {
    console.log('hello');
}

// accessing a method
student.greet(); // hello
Run Code
In the above example, an empty student object is created. Then, the name property is added. Similarly, the greet method is also added. In this way, you can add a method as well as property to an object.

JavaScript this Keyword
To access a property of an object from within a method of the same object, you need to use the this keyword. Let's consider an example.

const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,

    // accessing name property by using this.name
    greet: function() { console.log('The name is' + ' ' + this.name); }
};

person.greet();
Run Code
Output

The name is Zerubabel
In the above example, a person object is created. It contains properties (name and age) and a method greet.

In the method greet, while accessing a property of an object, this keyword is used.

In order to access the properties of an object, this keyword is used following by . and key.

Note: In JavaScript, this keyword when used with the object's method refers to the object. this is bound to an object.

However, the function inside of an object can access it's variable in a similar way as a normal function would. For example,

const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        let surname = 'Doe';
        console.log('The name is' + ' ' + this.name + ' ' + surname); }
};

person.greet();
Run Code
Output

The name is Zerubabel wondwesssen
